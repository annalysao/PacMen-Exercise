# PacMen-Exercise

## Description of the project: 
This project displays two buttons: 'Add Pacman' and 'Start Game'. When you press the 'Add Pacman' button, a pacman appears. Once you have add the number of pacmen you want to play with, you can press the 'Start Game' button, which begins to move the various pacmen around the screen. You can continue to add more pacmen after starting.

## How to Run: 
1. Download the HTML and JS files locally.
2. Drag and drop index.html into your browser.
3. Click the 'Add Pacman' button.
4. Click the 'Start Game' button.

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
1. When you press the 'Add pacman' button, one of four random styles of pacman will be created.
2. When one pacman hits another pacman, both pacmen will disappear.
3. The 'Add pacman' button will create one pacman. When that pacman hits a wall and changes direction, it will change the image to reflect the new direction. The image will also switch at a setInterval between the open mouth and close mouth pacman to show pacman 'eating' as it moves.
